# Parent Repository for the bachelor thesis of Arne Matthes
This Organization contains all repositories, which were created during the development and writing of the bachelor thesis with the title "Developing a Mobile Application for the IoT over Named Data Networking (IoT-NDN)".

# Goal of the thesis
The goal of this thesis was to evaluate if the new communication protocol [NDN](https://named-data.net/) is already in a state where it can be used for an IoT mobile application.

# Results
While still having a lot of problems, [NDN](https://named-data.net/) can theoretically already be used for mobile IoT communication. But as of right now there a quite a lot of problems with it, which must be solved before 
NDN can be used effectively.
